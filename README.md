## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Ranit Ghosh

ðŸš€ I've been working on hands-on projects using **Spring JDBC**, which are still under development â€” currently kept private.  
Stay tuned â€” theyâ€™ll be made public very soon!

ðŸ’» Passionate about backend development, database connectivity, and writing clean, production-ready Java code.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
